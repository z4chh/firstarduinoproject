# firstarduinoproject
This is my first arduino project that I created during my first quarter as a freshman EE student.
The purpose of the project was to create an anti-theft device that could be controlled with a remote.
Once the alarm is turned on via the IR remote, the MPU-6050 gyroscopic module detects movement of the entire system and then sounds the alarm. 
Once the alarm goes off, it will continue to go off until turned off with the IR remote.
Here is a link to a demonstration of the project https://youtu.be/cmV_eEDjSYI
